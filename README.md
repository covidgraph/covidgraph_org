# Develop

To help developing the website/web app, all you need is a Structr instance (https://structr.com/download or create a sandbox on https://structr.com). It's free and open source (community edition should be fine but we provide also free enterprise licenses for this project - just ask @amorgner).

To start development, just import the content of this repo into a running Structr instance using the deployment import which can be found on the dashboard.

The easiest way is to just use the ZIP file from here: https://github.com/covidgraph/covidgraph_org/raw/master/covidgraph-structr-app.zip
